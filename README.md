# Chiron
#### Because it sounded rather better than "Socrates" :P
Chiron makes the ReMo mentors' mentee tracking much less PITA and way more practical than that can ([theoretically](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc=application%20form&resolution=---&resolution=DUPLICATE&resolution=WONTFIX&resolution=FIXED&emailtype1=exact&query_format=advanced&emailassigned_to1=1&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&email1=debloper%40gmail.com&component=Mentorship&product=Mozilla%20Reps "Won't work unless you're in BuzZilla Reps' group, sorry!")) be done from BugZilla interface.

It takes only the Rep mentor's bugzilla ID, and will list down all the mentees (s)he has at that particular moment.
